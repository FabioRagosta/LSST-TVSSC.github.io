										<h2>Riley Clarke</h2>
										<p>
											Riley received a B.S. in Physics from Western Washington University and M.S. in Physics from the University of Delaware, where he is working on completing his Ph.D under supervision of Dr. Federica Bianco studying rapid brightening of stars called "flares". He is a member of the <a href="https://lsst-tvssc.github.io/">Rubin LSST Transients and Variable Stars Science Collaboration</a> and works on enabling the study of stellar flares in the LSST Wide Fast Deep survey by taking advantage of atmospheric refraction. From a family of professional musicians, Riley enjoys playing guitar and trumpet recreationally, and formerly competed in Solo-Ensemble contests in his home state of Alaska.

                                        Federica is an Assistant Professor at the University of Delaware in the Departments of Physics and Astronomy and in the Biden School of Public Policy and Administration and a Resident Faculty in the Data Science Institute.

                                        She works on data-driven solutions to problems that span from the nature of explosions in the sky to delays energy needs in cities. She studies lightcurves, time series of light, in astronomy to understand stellar evolution and cosmology, and in the urban environment at the Urban Observatory, where the study of urban lightcurves enables sociological, ecologic, economic inference.

                                        She is a TED 2019 fellow. Watch her 2019 <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/federica_bianco_how_we_use_astrophysics_to_study_earthbound_problems">TED talk</a>!

                                        She is the Deputy Project Scientist for <a href="lsst.org">Rubin Construction</a> and the Co-Chair of the <a href="https://lsst-tvssc.github.io/">Rubin LSST Transients and Variable Stars Science Collaboration</a>. She is the forme Coordinator of the eight <a href="https://www.lsstcorporation.org/science-collaborations">Rubin LSST Science Collaborations</a>.
                                        When not sciencing, she likes fighting.    
                                        Pre pandemic, she was a professional boxer with a record of 4-1, 2KOs
                                            
                                            Years ago, she studied piano at the Niccolo Paganin Conservatory in her home town of Genova, Italy.
